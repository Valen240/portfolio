  <h1>Hello, my name is Erick, <span>welcome to my portfolio site!</span></h1>

  <p>Collaborating with others to help come up with a solution to a problem is something I enjoy immensely. I am a highly inquisitive individual driven by my desire to know the &#39;why&#39; and understand the &#39;how&#39;, enabling me to get the most of the user research I conduct.

      <img src="img/GoodCompany.jpg" alt="Work Sample 2" >
      <p>I was tasked with coming up with an idea to use technology to help solve social issues amongst senior citizens living in a living facility. The result was Good Company, an application that helped seniors get to know newcomers and thus reduce social isolation. I was the core designer.</p>

      <p>A responsive web application, Perfect Properties gives the user the ability to more easily see a smart property investment they would potentially make. With a heavy focus on UI design, I used grids for each breakpoint to design the mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.</p>
